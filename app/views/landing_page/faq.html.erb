  <li> <strong> Why CSS:Markupwand? </strong>
  <p>
    We believe a developer's productive time shouldn't be spent that fighting their way through Photoshop to build web pages. That is what CSS:Markupwand tries to solve. 

    Upload your photoshop design and with a click you have your CSS styles ready for each layer. 
  </p>
  
  <li> <strong>But Why should I use CSS:Markupwand? </strong>
    <p>
    Unlike similar tools, CSS:Markupwand is completely web based. <b> We are trying to totally eliminating the need for Photoshop to a web developer. </b>
  </p>

<li>
  <strong>Why do you use SCSS/Compass and not &lt;insert favourite css framework&gt;?</strong>
  <p>It is just matter of initial choice. We are looking to use other major css frameworks soon.
