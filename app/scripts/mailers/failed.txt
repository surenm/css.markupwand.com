Hi %recipient_fname%,

We are sorry, your page generation didn't go well. We are in early beta and we have some trouble understanding your PSD. We are working hard to make Markupwand handle all PSDs.

Meanwhile, here are some tricks to get it right:
(1) Split a page into pieces 
(2) Use one text layer per logical text piece 
(3) Have one layer per image/icon. 

Thanks,
Raj

PS: If your work involves lot of PSD to HTML&CSS conversion, we'd love to talk to you.
