Hi. We are Markupwand.
Creating a website requires to convert a Design to HTML.
A developer has to Manually do this.

This is a problem. Because - it takes 2-3 days, you have to make it work across browsers, and honestly nobody likes doing this job.

That is why we build Markupwand. With markupwand, you could just throw in a photoshop file and get back high quality HTML. 

Why is Markupwand better? It just takes 5 minutes which is over 500 times faster than manual. It takes care of cross browser issues and it delivers maintainable code.

How do we know this works?
When we launched on hacker news, we were the top story for 2 days. Developers love us.

The number of pages we deliver is growing at 83%, week over week.

Infact, in last 3 weeks, we have saved 18 years of developer time.

Lets look at the market size. There are atleast 750,000 Developers going through this pain every-single-day.

Even at a conservative price of $100 per month, we are looking at a $1B market.

To summarize, we are solving, a painful problem, Our solution, is growing at 83%, and it is a 1 Billion dollar market.

We are creating a world where people never have to write HTML by hand. We are markupwand.
