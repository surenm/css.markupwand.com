So, we built markupwand. You could just throw a Photoshop file to Markupwand and get back HTML in minutes.

It is over 500x faster. Because it is fast, you could do multiple iterations.

The day we launched, we were the top-story in Hacker News. 
> Hackers loved the idea vs. Hackers loved the product.

Since we launched, we have been growing in number of successful conversions at x% rate.

What is best, we saved 10 Developer Years in just 3 weeks.

So, with a painful problem and a working solution - what is the market size?

(Math follows)
More than x people do UI Development. And they pay $200 at least (indian chopshops). If they pay just $100 per month, just HTML conversion itself is a $1B market.

To summarize,
1 - We are working on a real pain problem
2 - We have a working solution
3 - This is a $1B Market.
